# Countries Explorer
This is a React app with Express backend made for a coding challenge from Bounce Insights.

Running on Vercel: https://countries-explorer-taupe.vercel.app/

# Running the app locally
## Start backend server
Open repository in your IDE

`cd` into the backend folder and run:

`npm install` to install all dependencies

`npm start` to start backend server

## Start frontend server

In `package.json` and `SearchPage.js` files change https://countries-explorer-backend.vercel.app url to http://localhost:4000 - that way your frontend would connect to your local backend.

In another terminal open frontend folder and run the same two commands:

`npm install` to install all dependencies

`npm start` to start backend server

You can then visit this app locally at http://localhost:3000
